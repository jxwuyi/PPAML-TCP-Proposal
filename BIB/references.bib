abstract     = {<p>We present a new Bayesian skill rating system which can be viewed as a
                generalisation of the Elo system used in Chess. The new system tracks the
                uncertainty about player skills, explicitly models draws, can deal with any
                number of competing entities and can infer individual skills from team results.
                Inference is performed by approximate message passing on a factor graph
                representation of the model. We present experimental evidence on the increased
                accuracy and convergence speed of the system compared to Elo and report on our
                experience with the new rating system running in a large-scale commercial online
                gaming service under the name of TrueSkill.</p>},

of interest no longer re- sembles a pizza box or a refrigerator,
but a warehouse full of computers. These new large datacenters are
quite different from traditional hosting facilities of earlier times
and cannot be viewed simply as a collection of co-located servers.
Large portions of the hardware and software resources in these facilities
must work in concert to efficiently deliver good levels of Internet
service performance, something that can only be achieved by a holistic
approach to their design and deployment. In other words, we must
treat the datacenter itself as one massive warehouse-scale computer
(WSC). We describe the architecture of WSCs, the main factors influencing
their design, operation, and cost structure, and the characteristics
of their software base. We hope it will be useful to architects and
programmers of today's WSCs, as well as those of future many-core
platforms which may one day implement the equivalent of today's WSCs
on a single board.},

  Abstract                 = {{The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning
over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments
in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian
methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream,
while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing
and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability
of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development
of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational
Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels
have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications.
This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while
providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition
and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year
PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous
knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is
assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear
algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities
would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained
introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for
courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal
processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive
support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400
exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for
a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while
solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the
publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material,
and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest
information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical
aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include
free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example
data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant
Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair
in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow
of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the
Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural
Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.}},

  Abstract                 = {Support Vector Machines ({SVMs}) suffer from a widely recognized scalability
problem in both memory use and computational time. To improve scalability,
we have developed a parallel {SVM} algorithm ({PSVM}), which reduces
memory use through performing a row-based, approximate matrix factorization,
and which loads only essential data to each machine to perform parallel
computation. Let n denote the number of training instances, p the
reduced matrix dimension after factorization (p is significantly
smaller than n), and m the number of machines. {PSVM} reduces the
memory requirement from O(n2) to O(np=m), and improves computation
time to O(np2=m). Empirical study shows {PSVM} to be effective. {PSVM}

  Abstract                 = {Attention is drawn to a method of sampling a finite population of N units with unequal probabilities and without replacement. The method was originally proposed by Stern \& Cover (1989) as a model for lotteries. The method can be characterized as maximizing entropy given coverage probabilities πi, or equivalently as having the probability of a selected sample proportional to the product of a set of `weights' wi. We show the essential uniqueness of the wi given the πi, and describe practical, geometrically convergent algorithms for computing the wi from the πi. We present two methods for stepwise selection of sampling units, and corresponding schemes for removal of units that can be used in connection with sample rotation. Inclusion probabilities of any order can be written explicitly in closed form. Second-order inclusion probabilities πij satisfy the condition \$0 < \pi\_{ij} < \pi\_i \pi\_j\$, which guarantees Yates \& Grundy's variance estimator to be unbiased, definable for all samples and always nonnegative for any sample size.},

We discuss questions of structure related to the implications for inference on cell counts arising from assumptions about log-linear model forms, and a class of simple and useful prior distributions on the parameters of log-linear models. We then discuss \^{a}€� local move \^{a}€� and \^{a}€� global move \^{a}€� Metropolis-Hastings simulation methods for exploring the posterior distributions for parameters and cell counts, focusing particularly on higher-dimensional problems. As a byproduct, we note potential uses of the \^{a}€� global move \^{a}€� approach for inference about numbers of tables consistent with a prescribed subset of marginal counts. Illustration and comparison of MCMC approaches is given, and we conclude with discussion of areas for further developments and current open issues.}},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents studies of the coordination of voluntary human
arm movements. A mathematical model is formulated which is shown
to predict both the qualitative features and the quantitative details
observed experimentally in planar, multijoint arm movements. Coordination
is modeled mathematically by defining an objective function, a measure
of performance for any possible movement. The unique trajectory which
yields the best performance is determined using dynamic optimization
theory. In the work presented here, the objective function is the
square of the magnitude of jerk (rate of change of acceleration)
of the hand integrated over the entire movement. This is equivalent
to assuming that a major goal of motor coordination is the production
of the smoothest possible movement of the hand. Experimental observations
of human subjects performing voluntary unconstrained movements in
a horizontal plane are presented. They confirm the following predictions
of the mathematical model: unconstrained point-to-point motions are
approximately straight with bell-shaped tangential velocity profiles;
curved motions (through an intermediate point or around an obstacle)
have portions of low curvature joined by portions of high curvature;
at points of high curvature, the tangential velocity is reduced;
the durations of the low-curvature portions are approximately equal.
The theoretical analysis is based solely on the kinematics of movement
independent of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system and is
successful only when formulated in terms of the motion of the hand
in extracorporal space. The implications with respect to movement
organization are discussed.},

of data stream applications, make the task of learning in streams
difficult. The authors aim to develop a new approach to classify

  Abstract                 = {This book provides a synthesis of concepts and materials that ordinarily
appear separately in time series and econometrics literature, presenting
a comprehensive review of both theoretical and applied concepts.
Perhaps the most novel feature of the book is its use of Kalman filtering
together with econometric and time series methodology. From a technical
point of view, state space models and the Kalman filter play a key
role in the statistical treatment of structural time series models.
This technique was originally developed in control engineering but
is becoming increasingly important in economics and operations research.
The book is primarily concerned with modeling economic and social
time series and with addressing the special problems that the treatment
of such series pose.},

  Abstract                 = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation
and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data
in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing.
The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development
of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such
as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics.

Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed
with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas
in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach
is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics.
Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It
should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested
in data mining in science or industry.

The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction)
to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks,
support vector machines, classification trees and boosting--the first
comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.

Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors
of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers
in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive
models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much
of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal
curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author
of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman
is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS,
and projection pursuit.

FROM THE REVIEWS:

TECHNOMETRICS "[This] is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates
on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use
them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As
a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably
be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

  Abstract                 = {Modern applications such as Internet traffic, telecommunication records,
and large-scale social networks generate massive amounts of data
with multiple aspects and high dimensionalities. Tensors (i.e., multi-way
arrays) provide a natural representation for such data. Consequently,
tensor decompositions such as Tucker become important tools for summarization
and analysis. One major challenge is how to deal with high-dimensional,
sparse data. In other words, how do we compute decompositions of
tensors where most of the entries of the tensor are zero. Specialized
techniques are needed for computing the Tucker decompositions for
sparse tensors because standard algorithms do not account for the
sparsity of the data. As a result, a surprising phenomenon is observed
by practitioners: Despite the fact that there is enough memory to
store both the input tensors and the factorized output tensors, memory
overflows occur during the tensor factorization process. To address
this intermediate blowup problem, we propose Memory-Efficient Tucker
(MET). Based on the available memory, MET adaptively selects the
right execution strategy during the decomposition. We provide quantitative
and qualitative evaluation of MET on real tensors. It achieves over
1000X space reduction without sacrificing speed; it also allows us
to work with much larger tensors that were too big to handle before.
Finally, we demonstrate a data mining case-study using MET.},

  Abstract                 = {In many practical problems---from tracking aircraft based on radar data to building a bibliographic database based on citation lists---we want to reason about an unbounded number of unseen objects with unknown relations among them. Bayesian networks, which define a fixed dependency structure on a finite set of variables, are not the ideal representation language for this task. This paper introduces contingent Bayesian networks ({CBNs}), which represent uncertainty about dependencies by labeling each edge with a condition under which it is active. A {CBN} may contain cycles and have infinitely many variables. Nevertheless, we give general conditions under which such a {CBN} defines a unique joint distribution over its variables. We also present a likelihood weighting algorithm that performs approximate inference in finite time per sampling step on any {CBN} that satisfies these conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Data stream values are often associated with multiple aspects. For
example, each value from environmental sensors may have an associated
type (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc) as well as location. Aside
from timestamp, type and location are the two additional aspects.
How to model such streams? How to simultaneously find patterns within
and across the multiple aspects? How to do it incrementally in a
streaming fashion? In this paper, all these problems are addressed
through a general data model, tensor streams, and an effective algorithmic
framework, window-based tensor analysis (WTA). Two variations of
WTA, independent- window tensor analysis (IW) and moving-window tensor
analysis (MW), are presented and evaluated extensively on real datasets.
Finally, we illustrate one important application, multi-aspect correlation
analysis (MACA), which uses WTA and we demonstrate its effectiveness
on an environmental monitoring application.},

time Or in data cubes (tensors), with product-branchcustomer sales
information And more generally, how to summarize high-order data
cubes (tensors) How to incrementally update these patterns over time
Matrix decompositions, like principal component analysis (PCA) and
variants, are invaluable tools for mining, dimensionality reduction,
feature selection, rule identification in numerous settings like
streaming data, text, graphs, social networks, and many more settings.
However, they have only two orders (i.e., matrices, like author and
keyword in the previous example). We propose to envision such higher-order
data as tensors, and tap the vast literature on the topic. However,
these methods do not necessarily scale up, let alone operate on semi-infinite
streams. Thus, we introduce a general framework, incremental tensor
analysis (ITA), which efficiently computes a compact summary for
high-order and high-dimensional data, and also reveals the hidden
correlations. Three variants of ITA are presented: (1) dynamic tensor
analysis (DTA); (2) streaming tensor analysis (STA); and (3) window-based
tensor analysis (WTA). In paricular, we explore several fundamental
design trade-offs such as space efficiency, computational cost, approximation
accuracy, time dependency, and model complexity. We implement all
our methods and apply them in several real settings, such as network
anomaly detection, multiway latent semantic indexing on citation
networks, and correlation study on sensor measurements. Our empirical
studies show that the proposed methods are fast and accurate and
that they find interesting patterns and outliers on the real datasets.},

In addition, several strategies are available for constructing hybrid algorithms. This paper outlines some of the basic methods and strategies and discusses some related theoretical and practical issues. On the theoretical side, results from the theory of general state space Markov chains can be used to obtain convergence rates, laws of large numbers and central limit theorems for estimates obtained from Markov chain methods. These theoretical results can be used to guide the construction of more efficient algorithms. For the practical use of Markov chain methods, standard simulation methodology provides several variance reduction techniques and also give guidance on the choice of sample size and allocation.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we study trajectory planning and control in voluntary,
human arm movements. When a hand is moved to a target, the central
nervous system must select one specific trajectory among an infinite
number of possible trajectories that lead to the target position.
First, we discuss what criterion is adopted for trajectory determination.
Several researchers measured the hand trajectories of skilled movements
and found common invariant features. For example, when moving the
hand between a pair of targets, subjects tended to generate roughly
straight hand paths with bell-shaped speed profiles. On the basis
of these observations and dynamic optimization theory, we propose
a mathematical model which accounts for formation of hand trajectories.
This model is formulated by defining an objective function, a measure
of performance for any possible movement: square of the rate of change
of torque integrated over the entire movement. That is, the objective
function CT is defined as follows: \$\$C\_T = \frac{1}{2}{}^t\int\limits\_0^f
{\sum\limits\_{i = 1}^n {\left( {\frac{{{\text{d}}z\_i }}{{{\text{d}}t}}}
\right)^2 {\text{d}}t,} } \$\$ where ziis the torque generated by
the i-th actuator (muslce) out of n actuators, and tfis the movement
time. Since this objective function critically depends on the complex
nonlinear dynamics of the musculoskeletal system, it is very difficult
to determine the unique trajectory which yields the best performance.
We overcome this difficult by developing an iterative scheme, with
which the optimal trajectory and the associated motor command are
simultaneously computed. To evaluate our model, human hand trajectories
were experimentally measured under various behavioral situations.
These results supported the idea that the human hand trajectory is
planned and controlled in accordance with the minimum torquechange
criterion.},

is a latent variable model. It comprises a low-dimensional latent
space with associated dynamics, as well as a map from the latent
space to an observation space. We marginalize out the model parameters
in closed form by using Gaussian process priors for both the dynamical
and the observation mappings. This results in a nonparametric model
for dynamical systems that accounts for uncertainty in the model.
We demonstrate the approach and compare four learning algorithms
on human motion capture data, in which each pose is 50-dimensional.
Despite the use of small data sets, the GPDM learns an effective
representation of the nonlinear dynamics in these spaces.},

    Abstract = {This document introduces the syntax of BLOG, a probabilistic programming language, for describing random variables and their probabilistic dependencies. BLOG defines probabilistic generative models over first-order structures. For example, all Bayesian networks can be easily described by BLOG. BLOG has the following features: 
(a) it employs open-universe semantics;
(b) it can describe relational uncertainty;
(c) it can handle identity uncertainty; and
(d) it is empowered by first-order logic.
The syntax as described in this document corresponds to BLOG version 0.6. The current version represents a significant redesign and extension to previous versions of BLOG, based on the principles of usability and implementation efficiency.}
